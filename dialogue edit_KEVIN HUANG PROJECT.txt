
Hey g0dzarmy!!!

Hope you are well man! 
You mentioned you might be able to help narrate something for me.
Well, I just wanted to contact you about your participation and support of my first documentary art project with video instead of still photographic cameras.

If you are still interested after reading this message in helping out with I really would love if you would narrate my very short video.  This video will be used to invite people to be interviewed. All dialogue needed is below.  Max time of the short film is about 6 minutes. This is not the final feature documentary that will be around 75 minutes long.

Thanks for reading this, I hope you will consider helping out :)
Oh, also, if I can pass along some funds for your service/help/support, please let me know a number in green backs :P

G0dzarmy Narration Script for Invitation Video






Hello, this is g0dzrmy. I play on the 312th's Inner hospital server in America's Army Proving Grounds.






You are watching this because I am hoping you will let me about a documentary film project QuantumBiotch/QuantumKevin is making on the AAPG game and community.



Kevin has a degree in fine arts photography from a Toronto, Canada University.
He has played trumpet in some ska bands and once bicycle 4 days from Toronto to Montreal.

He is hoping to make his first video documentary flim rather than photographic documentaries.

The tag line for the documentary is something like:  Quantumbiotch: A Documentary for Parents of Children Gamers with Mental Health Issues.


There are three parts to the documentary.  The first is auto-biographic, the second reviews of 6 games. The third part will interview the gamer community in AAPG, the devs/beta testers, as well as professors and professionals that work in the mental health, addiction, and critical media studies.
The final part will be public gaming in a park, main street corner as a busker in Toronto (though any tips I get will go 100% all to charity, not 100% of proceeds. And finally I will game in a gallery. Each of this locations will consist of 12 hours of non-interrupted 312th Clan's Inner hospital server gaming.

Kevin would like to formally request your participation as an interviewee in the game and/or via webcam. Also, if anyone is curious and interested enough, Kevin lives near Toronto, Canada, I would love to fly out and do in person video interview. 

Thanks for watching this!

Here now is a short film describing my experience so far with AAPG and it's community.
You can now skip the rest of the video.
